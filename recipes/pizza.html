      To make a classic pizza, start by preparing the pizza dough. In a mixing
      bowl, combine warm water, active dry yeast, sugar, and a bit of olive oil.
      Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it's frothy. Then, gradually add
      flour and salt, mixing until a dough forms. Knead it for a few minutes,
      then let it rise in a warm place for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the dough has risen, roll it out into a thin crust and place it on a
      pizza stone or baking sheet. Preheat your oven to a high temperature,
      around 475째F (245째C). Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough,
      leaving a border for the crust. Add your favorite toppings like cheese,
      vegetables, and meats. Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes,
      or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly
      browned. Remove from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice
      and serve.
